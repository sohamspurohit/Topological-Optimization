# Topological-Optimization
Topology optimization (TO) is a mathematical method that optimizes material layout within a given design space, 
for a given set of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the goal of maximizing the performance of the 
system. 

TO is different from shape optimization and sizing optimization in the sense that the design can attain any shape 
within the design space, instead of dealing with predefined configurations.

These sets of codes include certain mathematical pre requisites involved in a full understanding of TO and their 
description is as follows:

##Numerical Analysis Techniques

This contains codes for some basic numerical analysis methods such as Newton's method, forward and 
backward Euler methods, one and two dimensional finite differences methods, and finally, one dimensional 
finite element method.

##Poisson.edp

This contains a demonstration of solving the Poisson's equation using FreeFem++, by defining the boundary, setting
up boundary conditions, and finally, visualising the solution to the differential equation.

##Assignment

Solved assignment to parametric shape optimization, the details and procedure is commented along with the code 
itself. A good reference, and a step ahead towards solving full blown TO problems.
